# AutomatingTuitions
A responsive and dynamic full-stack application that helped my Calculus tutor carry out his daily classes and made life easier for him. This is an application that consists of three different portals, each with
their own unique features. The three portals cater to the 3 different types of user that use this application: the client (my calculus tutor) for whom this application was built, his students, and for 
their parents. 

# Purpose of Creation
The client of this application was my online Calculus tutor in 2022. He is a tutor who follows a
complex routine because of the high-volume of students that he teaches online. He
teaches students AP Calculus BC.

After consultation with my client, I gained cognizance of the problems he faced as a tutor at the company he worked at. The process of creating assessments and providing subsequent feedback was inefficient. The client had to create assessments from scratch and distribute these exams via WhatsApp. To mark it, he then had to wait for every student to send their test back (again via WhatsApp). Finally, the admin at the tutoring agency he worked for would receive student grades from the client who would then send them across to students. This complicated process of assessing a student’s test added stress and pressure to his daily routine. Additionally, the client used multiple Excel Sheets to keep track of classes, relied on students to send relevant documents of their assessments and/or homework via WhatsApp. Moreover, when sending reminders and results of homework, the client had to send out individual messages to the 44 students that he tutored, making it extremely time-consuming. Consequently, data had to be manually extracted when sending it over to the parents. The client didn’t have enough time to cater to the questions of the 44 students that he tutored; often, the questions asked were generic, such as ‘When is the next assessment?’ or ‘When is the deadline to submit the homework?’. Hence, the previous inefficient system impacted his stress levels and the quality of his teaching.

# How the Full-stack application was created?
- The following full-stack application was created using the Netbeans IDE for the front-end and PostGressSQL for the back-end. It utilized inbuilt GUI features of Netbeans for the front-end (written in Java) and heavily utilized Java and SQL for the
back-end.

# Design of the Application
- I didn't straight away code the application, but I only began coding after weeks of intense planning. The planning included drawing a hierarchal modular design diagram, level 0 and level 1
data flow diagrams, SQL tables (for the database used in the back-end of the application), Entity-Relationship Diagrams, Design of each form/application which I manually and edited as per the client's
expectations. Please see the link below giving the aforementioned details: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tZ8efrRHLbjcxq_b8AZg7NiAA0auQRBk/view?usp=sharing

# Techniques Utilized 
- Please refer to the following document as it gives you a comprehensive guide of the tech-stack used in this application. I also utlized complex data structures such as arraylists when dealing with
data related to student's homework submission, quiz results and how this could be represented across the 3 different "portals" of the application (teacher, student, client).

# Evaluation of the Application 
- In order to make sure I matched the expectations of the client, I regulary evalued my application which has been documented in the document below. Please click on the link to view the evaluation.
