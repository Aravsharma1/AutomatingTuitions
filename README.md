# AutomatingTuitions
A responsive and dynamic full-stack application that helped my Calculus tutor carry out his daily classes and made life easier for him. 

# Purpose of Creation
The client of this application was my online Calculus tutor in 2022. He is a tutor who follows a
complex routine because of the high-volume of students that he teaches online. He
teaches students AP Calculus BC.

After consultation with my client, I gained cognizance of the problems he faced as a tutor at the company he worked at. The process of creating assessments and providing subsequent feedback was inefficient. The client had to create assessments from scratch and distribute these exams via WhatsApp. To mark it, he then had to wait for every student to send their test back (again via WhatsApp). Finally, the admin at Meccademia would receive student grades from the client who would then send them across to students. This complicated process of assessing a student’s test added stress and pressure to his daily routine. Additionally, the client used multiple Excel Sheets to keep track of classes, relied on students to send relevant documents of their assessments and/or homework via WhatsApp. Moreover, when sending reminders and results of homework, the client had to send out individual messages to the 44 students that he tutored, making it extremely time-consuming. Consequently, data had to be manually extracted when sending it over to the parents. The client didn’t have enough time to cater to the questions of the 44 students that he tutored; often, the questions asked were generic, such as ‘When is the next assessment?’ or ‘When is the deadline to submit the homework?’. Hence, the previous inefficient system impacted his stress levels and the quality of his teaching.
